# CCDH Resources

## CRDC-H Model in LinkML
The CCDH model will be published in the [LinkML](https://linkml.github.io/) data description format. Doing so allows us to leverage the existing LinkML tool ecosystem, which includes tools for generating a number of useful artifacts, including model documentation, representations of the model in CSV and OWL, representations used for validating data such as JSON Schema and ShEx, and artifacts for interfacing with other technologies such as GraphQL and JSON-LD. This repository contains tools for converting the CCDH model into LinkML, and holds the LinkML model and its downstream artifacts for public use. By locating the LinkML model here, we can also leverage GitHub tools such as issue tracking and pull requests to provide versioning and maintain a history of changes to the model over time.

The CRDC harmonized model can be found with the [cancerDHC repository](http://github.com/cancerDHC/ccdhmodel/).

## Example Data Workflow
The example data workflow will ensure that the products of several CCDH workflows work well together in order to provide an exemplar workflow to demonstrate the use of transformation and validation tools on both the CRDC-H model as well as data that conforms to that model. This will include (1) the conversion of the CRDC-H from a series of spreadsheets into a LinkML model, (2) validating that the generated LinkML model is correctly specified, (3) downloading example data from several CRDC nodes and eventually from the CDA, (4) transforming these example data into instance data in the CRDC-H data model, and (5) testing that the transformed example data can be validated against the CRDC-H data model in LinkML. We plan to have a basic functioning workflow ready for use by May 31, 2021.

[Example data](http://www.github.com/cancerDHC/example-data) is available.

## NCIt-plus
The NCIt OBO Edition is an [OBO Foundry](http://obofoundry.org/) library-friendly version of the NCI Thesaurus. The OBO Foundry is a community of ontology developers who are committed to developing ontologies under a shared set of principles, including reusing each otherâ€™s existing ontologies and ensuring interoperability between ontologies. The NCIt-plus is an extension of the NCIt OBO Edition providing a deeper integration with ontologies from the OBO library.

While NCIt-plus contains the same labels and terminology as the original NCIt, NCIt-plus replaces the classes and corresponding identifiers of specific concept hierarchies in NCIt with those provided by domain-specific ontologies from the OBO Library, for use in the logical axioms of the disease terminology. This allows for increased interoperability of the NCIt with other OBO ontologies. For example, NCIt anatomical terms and logical relationships are replaced by corresponding concepts from [Uberon](http://uberon.github.io/). Currently, Uberon and [Cell Ontology](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology) are included in NCIt Plus; current efforts are underway to extend this integration to terminologies including [Gene Ontology](http://geneontology.org/) (for biological processes, molecular function and cellular components) and  the [NCBI taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) (for organisms). The build pipeline also makes available some smaller subsets of NCIt, such as a subset of NCIt Plus focused on the [Neoplasm Core](https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/NCI_Thesaurus/Neoplasm/About_Core.html), as well as a slim based on terms used in [OncoTree](http://oncotree.mskcc.org/oncotree/#/home). More information about available downloads can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/NCI-Thesaurus/thesaurus-obo-edition/wiki/Downloads). Our ultimate goal is to adopt OBO conventions for term identifiers and ontology dereferencing to improve semantic integration with existing OBO ontologies.

## Harmonization of concepts
Data harmonization entails the standardization of terms and concepts with controlled vocabularies, such as ontologies or standardized elements, to allow for interoperability and computability of concepts. The CRDC nodes created mappings of terms used by their resources to [National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (NCIt)](https://ncithesaurus.nci.nih.gov/ncitbrowser/pages/home.jsf?version=20.11e) and [NIH Common Data Elements (CDEs)](https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/home), and these were obtained by the CCDH team and reviewed and iterated upon. Initial work involved a manual review of the mappings provided by the nodes. Where appropriate, we added new NCIt mapping via lookup in the [CDE Browser](https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/cde/search), if a term was not already mapped. We reviewed the existing mappings and updated the mapping if we determined a more suitable mapping was available. These revised mappings were shared with the nodes for their review and approval, and we iterated on the mappings to produce the final harmonized data sets. This process also identified gaps in NCIt, for which new term requests will be made.
